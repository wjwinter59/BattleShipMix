* History :
  Started learning C# because I'm interested in Oop, so I needed some sort of project to work on. 
    For some reason I stunbled on the boardgame Battleship and decided 'This is it !!' :).
  
  After a lot of reading, programming other things, coffee, strating over, reading about patterns, moments of frustration, seeing light's, talking with goeroes ....
    This is what I have done so far, mind you it's not finished yet :). 
    It's capable of creating a situation where :
      - you'l have a resizable Gameboard with a fleet of 5 default battleships for each player.
      - yes, three players (?) to begin with,  two humans one computer.
      - a List of boardlocations that are occupied with parts of ships, buffers and water.
    
    To Do  
      - Place the ships at random places on the board for each player.
      - Figger out hoe to play this game with more than two players.
      - Give players the abillity to actual play a move.
      - End the game for al sorts of situations. 
          Like someone won, cant't play a move, no space for more than x ships on the resizable board etc etc 
  
  I started using GIT from the start so I was able to follow the moments of new insight's, frustrations, starting over etc ... :)

  Enjoy !
